Hayley Hadges
-A Day in the Life of Hayley Hadges


I'm not a morning person, but I also don't enjoy rushing my mornings.

I get up at 9 and drink some Keurig coffee with sweet cream creamer.

I get ready for the day, specifically, showing my face on Zoom.

After my Software Development class, I either nap or do homework for my other class. In software dev, Betsy usually asks me for help (hey, it's Betsy)

Then, I go to my other class for the day, which is a sociology class about children.

After class, I spend a bunch of hours doing homework and working on publicity for MacCL.

If I have any extra free time after this, I might watch Netflix!
