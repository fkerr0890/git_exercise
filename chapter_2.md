Hey all, my name is Fred.
This is a day in the life.
FIRST, I RISE FROM MY CHAMBER.
This is shaping up to be a good day. "I'll take my breakfast in bed, Butler."
Butler hurries off, with a pep in his step.
I pour over the news for a few minutes.
Butler rushes in with a steaming tray of fruit and buns.
In his haste, he spills a drop of my coffee on my bed.
My beautiful white comforter is ruined.
Instinctively, he bends over for a spanking.
